# Aiport API Service

Airport API Service is a Django-based RESTful API for managing airports, routes, crews, airplane types, airplanes, flights, orders, and tickets. The API provides endpoints to create, update, and retrieve essential airline-related data. It supports filtering, searching, and ordering of flights and other resources. Access permissions are configured so that only admins can modify data, while authenticated users have read-only access.
